/**
 * Node filter interface. Provide an implementing class to [NodeTraversor] to iterate through nodes.
 *
 *
 * This interface provides two methods, `head` and `tail`. The head method is called when the node is first
 * seen, and the tail method when all of the node's children have been visited. As an example, head can be used to
 * create a start tag for a node, and tail to create the end tag.
 *
 *
 *
 * For every node, the filter has to decide whether to:
 *
 *  * continue ([FilterResult.CONTINUE]),
 *  * skip all children ([FilterResult.SKIP_CHILDREN]),
 *  * skip node entirely ([FilterResult.SKIP_ENTIRELY]),
 *  * remove the subtree ([FilterResult.REMOVE]),
 *  * interrupt the iteration and return ([FilterResult.STOP]).
 *
 * The difference between [FilterResult.SKIP_CHILDREN] and [FilterResult.SKIP_ENTIRELY] is that the first
 * will invoke [NodeFilter.tail] on the node, while the latter will not.
 * Within [NodeFilter.tail], both are equivalent to [FilterResult.CONTINUE].
